# 42_Piscine_1016

The projects are a combination of both individual and group projects I completed during School 42 USA's October Piscine.

Directories beginning with D0XX are the invidivual days during the piscine with the XX representing the day of assignment. 

Rush projects were group projects that were accomplished by a randomly assigned group.

As these files were a way to measure my progression during this month, there are many errors, bugs and cases that aren't accounted for.
